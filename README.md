***üöÄ  Features***

- Predicts if a Test match will end in a draw based on match configuration.
- If not a draw, predicts the winning team with the upper hand.
- Displays a probability breakdown chart.
- Automatically updates UI based on selected teams (e.g., Toss Winner dropdown).
- Interactive and easy-to-use UI powered by Gradio.

***üß† Models Used***

The app uses machine learning classifiers trained on historical match data. Multiple models were evaluated using GridSearch and cross-validation to identify the best performers.

****Evaluated Models:****
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Gradient Boosting

****Final Model Selection:****
- ‚úÖ Draw Prediction:
K-Nearest Neighbors was found to be the best model based on evaluation metrics such as F1-score and ROC AUC. It provided the most balanced performance in distinguishing draw outcomes.

- ‚úÖ Winner Prediction (when not a draw):
Gradient Boosting Classifier outperformed others with the highest accuracy and F1-score, making it the most reliable model for predicting the winning team when a result is expected.
